# purpose

Dialation sucks. so we built a better dialator.
It has a ptfe nanotech coating to make it super slippy so insertion doesn't hurt.

# get one

We will be doing a batch soon!
They cost about $60 per dialator to manifacture so expect it will cost a bit more then that with shiping and stuff.

# name
we chose chrysalis becuse it's the thing that helps buterfiles undergo metamorphisis
